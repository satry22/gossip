**Gossip News**

Gossip is a news site for entertainment and media news. The user can read articles about celebrities, entertainment.

I have had a lot going on in my personal life recently, and I have not been able to give this project the time it needs.
I realize it is still largely based upon the Codestar repo, and I am planning to keep working on this and make it my own code and submit again, a finished project. I am not happy with what I am submitting, but it is all I have at this point.


**Features Left to Implement**
Admins has ability to post Gossip articles
Admin has ability to write drafts
Users can registrate for member accounts
Users has ability to read and leave comments
